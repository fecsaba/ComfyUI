Használja ki FLD-5B adatkészletünket, amely 5,4 milliárd megjegyzést tartalmaz 126 millió képen, hogy elsajátítsa a többfeladatos tanulást. A modell sorozatról-szekvenciára architektúrája lehetővé teszi, hogy mind a nulla lövés, mind a finomhangolt beállításokban kiváló legyen, így versenyképes látásalapmodellnek bizonyul.\n",
